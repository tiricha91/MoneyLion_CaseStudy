In in an interview with Medium.com, CEO Diwakar admits that the idea for MoneyLion originated from large banks backing away from consumer business as a result of the financial crisis and the subsequent regulations that followed. The vacume that the large banks left behind was an oportunity that stared him in the face. He did not have the thechnical or egineering expertise to seize on this venture on his own. He did, however, have two other co-founders who understood the technology side of things. Diwakar further explains the origins of MoneyLion:

 > We were also excited that consumers at the time were showing a growing appetite for utilizing online banking services that reduced transaction times and made banking less intrusive to their lives. This led us to our decision to start MoneyLion in 2013 with the underlying feeling that this was an incredible opportunity to build and reimagine the consumer financing brand.
